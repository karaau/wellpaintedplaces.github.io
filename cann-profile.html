							<h1>Well Painted Places</h1>
							<p class="major">A profile of Nathan Cann by <a href="https://karaau.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kara Au</a></p>
							
							<p class="essay">In February of 2020, one month before the world would be engulfed by the coronavirus, <a href="https://nattcann.com/" style="text-decoration:underline;">Nathan Cann</a> embarked on a journey to the Magdalen Islands. A French-speaking archipelago in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, it sits isolated from the province of Quebec to which it belongs. Many of its inhabitants work seasonally in fishing, mining, and tourism—in the winter, they warm their bodies with ale.</p>
							
							<p class="essay">Cann arrives at one of the most inhospitable times of the year, some of the islands being inaccessible due to harsh snowstorms. Residing on Cap-aux-Meules, the most populated island in the archipelago, he peers outside the window of his room and sees nothing but the blinding whiteness of snow moving at light speed. He notes that upon his arrival he is greeted by well-painted places—well-kempt houses richly adorned in radiant colours. The frigid winds pelt snow and ice against the siding, but the colours act like warding amulets to protect the people inside and enliven those outside.</p>
						
						<p class="essay">Despite the clear dangers, Cann gets into his car and drives precariously to the local microbrewery, À l'abri de la Tempête (which roughly translates to “shelter from the storm” in English). Upon arrival, he sees that many of its inhabitants have commuted via snowmobile. They handle the weather with casual disregard; despite the harsh conditions, the Island’s people live with the storm as a natural colleague.</p>

						<p class="essay">In going to the Magdalens, Cann is in search of its haunting. Not ghosts or possessed buildings, but something that ultimately draws and ties its inhabitants to stay in a place far removed from the mainland. In Mi’kmak, the Magdalens are called “Menagoesenog” or “islands swept by the surf.” It has over 400 recorded shipwrecks in its history, some survivors choosing to settle. The islands have a history of colonization while also serving as a home to victims from Le Grand Dérangement, the mass expulsion of Acadians from some Maritime provinces by the British in the mid 1700s. The islands themselves are experiencing increased erosion and heightened temperatures leading to less protection in the winter on top of rising water levels creating washouts.</p>

						<p class="essay">Still, its people stay, using their well-painted homes like guiding beacons. Cann sees this, and by searching for hauntings, it feels like he is seeking avenues for hope. By tracing histories, landmarks, and symbols that draw inhabitants to form communities, he also uncovers the struggles that bind its people together, finding strength not just through unending optimism, but also weathering the storms ahead. There is no conclusion, no ritual to exercise, purify, or save the islands, the only choice being to live day-by-day.</p>

						<p class="essay">Arriving to complete his residency project, Colis suspect, with the local contemporary art organization, AdMare, he did not know that it would be his final journey before the World Health Organization would announce a global pandemic. In March of 2020, New Brunswick would begin to feel the effects of the coronavirus. The virus would fundamentally change how we communicate and engage with each other as we scramble to figure out our “new normal,” one with restricted barriers and greater distances. Companies would change their policies, including the approval to work from home to reduce the spread of a dangerously contagious virus. I would lose my job as funds halted in digital ad buying, only a skeleton crew remaining. It is during this time of unrest that I get to know Cann and his artistic practice as a printmaker.</p>

						<p class="essay">First trained as a painter, Cann was introduced to printmaking by Erik Edson, now the Department Head of Mount Allison University in fine arts and professor in printmaking, drawing, and open media. He immediately made the switch. While a patient mentor, Cann is an impatient practitioner—stretching canvas and waiting for paint to dry felt excruciatingly slow to him. Printmaking allowed him to work faster and thus experiment more. He doesn’t shy from failure, doesn’t obsess over keeping every little thing, and doesn’t make every print out to be some precious object; the process of him creating is as significant as the final product. Every week, I feel like he is telling me about a new method he is trying just for the sake of seeing what happens.</p>

						<p class="essay">Cann’s most well-known works, monoprints of old and sometimes dilapidated buildings against imagery of New Brunswick’s monopolized industries, beget a haunting. Irving signs, refineries, and other signs of industry juxtaposed against homes, cities, forests, and churches, displaying the embeddedness of private influences building the cultural narrative of labour and collective identity in the province. These overlays float atop one another, producing spirit-like monoliths.</p>

							<p class="essay">Nathan Cann, <em>Ruin 1</em> (2020). Monoprint, acetone and xylene photo transfer type, 20” x 24”.</p>
							
						<p class="essay">In his monoprints of the Magdalens, Cann links well-painted places and derelict buildings with fishing boats and symbols of ocean labour. In <em>Blue (2020)</em>, a blue house with salmon trim lies right side up, blending into an upside down fishing vessel. However, the print can be orientated in any direction, displaying the co-dependent and circular nature of the island’s people with the ocean. The waters provide sustenance and safe travel, allowing visitors to come and go by ferry, but not all is well in this relationship; threats from global warming and unsteady weather also makes the waters that protect them serve as a threat to their way of living.</p>

						<p class="essay">Every time I meet with Cann, we inevitably get off topic. I’ve given up on bringing notebooks or planning questions ahead of time. He has a disarming personality and treats strangers and friends the same, leading to much confusion on my end. As we sit at a café, I ask him to identify each passerby he greets, and it’s split between a real name and “no idea.” None of it is an act. Yet, that same familiarity is what makes him an enigma, blurring friend and stranger. I don’t fully understand what motivates him to create. I sip my coffee and ask Cann why he makes art; he shrugs calmly, saying he’s not sure, but it’s one of the only things in the world that he can do. It feels natural.</p>

						<p class="essay">I later meet Cann at the Saint John Arts Centre and we both arrive sporting masks. Experiencing a sudden bout of anxiety, I check my purse to confirm that I didn’t forget my hand sanitizer. Times have changed. I have asked Cann to teach me printmaking so that I can better understand his practice. I am not an artist: I didn’t go to art school, I don’t know how to print, paint, cut, or assemble. I know next to nothing about colour, and I’ve spent an uncomfortable amount of my life envying the lives of professional artists. In no way did I glamourize the lifestyle of one of the most precarious careers you can have—as an artist, you are not free from constraint or the politics of art and funding organizations—but I envied each artist’s individual assertion that they would find a way to create for a living and stand behind the work that they make.</p>

						<p class="essay">We start with linocut. Cann is the very opposite of elitist: he answers my questions with calm nonchalance while I observe him mixing magenta pigment for my series of prints. I am mesmerized while listening to the soft sound of the metal spatula pressing into the glass countertop, spreading and gathering colour. It feels more like a therapy session than a workshop. As Cann works on his own project, I carefully push the Speedball cutter into a small, grey linoleum rectangle. My lines are jagged and clumsy and I barely miss my finger, but I’m satisfied looking at each indent I create. The final product is grossly novice but I still feel accomplished and look forward to our next session.</p>

						<p class="essay">We try eco-printing using alum powder, vinegar, and coffee at our next scheduled meetup. I iron over the newspaper covering the foraged wildflowers with excessive force, tearing the paper. The final result is a moldy, fungal coloured splotch resembling a Rorschach test. I look over to Cann’s alum print—it possesses delicate pastel hues in contrast to his loud appearance: flamingo pink sunglasses with a matching button-up shirt. A humbling experience, through these workshops, I am given better context into the skill Cann brings to his art practice.</p>

						<p class="essay">I later ask Cann if being isolated on the Magdalens shared any similarities to isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. He looks up, thinking, then shakes his head. “Not really,” he says, because on the Magdalens, he still has a choice: stay home or brave the cold to meet others. These days, it feels like there is only one choice we can make, but life doesn’t seem simpler. The world feels more complex than ever. In spite of this, Cann looks relaxed. I don’t think anything can fell his steady spirit.</p>
